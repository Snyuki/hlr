==> Error: `spack load` requires Spack's shell support.
  
  To set up shell support, run the command below for your shell.
  
  For bash/zsh/sh:
    . /opt/spack/20220821/share/spack/setup-env.sh
  
  For csh/tcsh:
    source /opt/spack/20220821/share/spack/setup-env.csh
  
  For fish:
    source /opt/spack/20220821/share/spack/setup-env.fish
  
  For Windows batch:
    source /opt/spack/20220821/share/spack/spack_cmd.bat
  
  Or, if you do not want to use shell support, run one of these instead:
  
      eval `spack load --sh   scorep`  # bash/zsh/sh
      eval `spack load --csh  scorep`  # csh/tcsh
      eval `spack load --fish scorep`  # fish
      eval `spack load --bat  scorep`  # batch
  
  If you have already set up Spack's shell support but still receive
  this message, please make sure to call Spack via the `spack` command
  without any path components (such as `bin/spack`).
